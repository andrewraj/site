I shared with a few friends that I bought a gimbal on Lazada, telling them what a deal I've gotten and what a gimbal is. Little did I know that this two friends of mine had plans for the gimbal more than I did. It was a bold move to pick a guy with a budget phone and a new gadget on his hands to shoot for their wedding. Thank God for the gimbal, because the fear of shooting a wedding video would have cause the whole video to look like a wedding in the middle of an earthquake. Anyways, I gave it a shot and purchased a premium videography app on the Play Store, packed a couple of additional SD cards & power banks and went to the wedding to show of my new gadget to everyone at the wedding. Here's the equipments used and the final outcome.

  * Camera  : Pocophone F1
  * App     : Filmic Pro
  * Gimbal  : Zhiyun Smooth 4
  * Editing : DaVinci Resolve 16
