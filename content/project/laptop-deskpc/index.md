When my wife came back from her 5 year education abroad, she brought back an almost dead laptop that was about to be thrown. An electronic waste was saved because she chose to marry me. Ripped open the already broken laptop and used the screen for the portable monitor project and the balance to build a desk PC for my sister. The motherboard & all the componenents are hidden at the back of the table while the system is being used through an external monitor. Here's some shots
