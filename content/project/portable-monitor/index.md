Came across a project on YouTube to repurpose an old laptop screen. Took the challenge, braced through hundreds of Chinese website's to understand and also purchased the components to get this working. Eventually planned the method to fit it all together and I carry it everywhere along with my laptop. Currently building another one with a smaller controller to make it even portable.
